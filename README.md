# Backpropagation
## Neural Network implemented in C++ with Backpropagation
- The maths behind the backpropagation has been implemented in Neural Network with C++. For training and testing we are using the logic gates.
- You can give the number of epochs and learning rate yourselves.
- The implemented activation functions are ReLU & sigmoid.
