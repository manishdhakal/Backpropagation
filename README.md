# Backpropagation
## Neural Network implemented in C++ with Backpropagation
- The maths behind the backpropagation has been implemented in Neural Network with C++. For training and testing we are using the logic gates.
- You can give the number of epochs and learning rate yourselves.
- The implemented activation functions are ReLU and sigmoid.
- The Logic gates have been implemented in this ANN for testing.

### Running the code
- Open the "ANN.sln" file from Visual Studio.
- Press the button "Local Windows Debugger" on the top.
